I would like to see more emphasis on team building and bonding activities to help foster a stronger sense of camaraderie. Additionally, while there is an emphasis on work autonomy, there can sometimes be a lack of direction or clarity around goals and expectations. More guidance and direction from managers would help ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals."", ""I appreciate the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and I have seen efforts to create a more diverse workforce. However, there is still a lack of representation at the leadership level, which can make it difficult for employees from underrepresented groups to feel truly valued and respected. While I think the company's recruitment policies are effective, it will be important to continue investing in leadership training for underrepresented groups to ensure that everyone has a chance to succeed. Additionally, there could be more emphasis on cultural competence training for all employees to help foster a more inclusive workplace culture.""]"
